Hi There!

My name is Nolan Robbins and I currently reside in Austin, TX.

I am a self-studying, aspiring student looking to get into the world of **Data Analysis** and ultimately **ML Engineering**.

On my profile, I included my first coding project which shows EDA and BI techniques to analyze a subset of some Amazon Sales Data!

I am currently working on an end-to-end ML pipeline for a HouseCanary Housing dataset that shows a regression analysis on the future prices of homes.
